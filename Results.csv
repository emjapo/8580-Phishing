Enron,THANK YOU,"CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD. LAGOS, NIGERIA ATTENTION:MADAM/SIR I am MR.USMAN ABACHA , the Director of Operations CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of Africa. I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on business proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through a consultant company base on my research for a trustworthy and established person that understands investment ethic for entering into a life time profitable joint partnership investment and also co-operation with confidence and trust that you will keep the contents secret and divulged to any third party. To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping. And since then our client has failed to come forward to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a considerable amount of money in demurrage. Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment had accumulated we discovered that our client was the former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care. Since the death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open the two boxes that our client deposited in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the two boxes that were registered as treasurer by our client actually contained a considerable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting to about US$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have been nursing plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and the foreign media that our late client siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was in office as head of state. It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our client siphoned and now that he is dead there is no race to this money in our care. I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me in transferring this money out of nigeria to your country for immediate investment with your assistance. I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your country. you have nothing to worry about, as I will be there to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper documentation. This transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter. Thanks. Yours faithfully. MR. USMAN ABDUL ",no,
Enron,BUSINESS OFFER," From: Mr. MALCOM TUTU (chief auditor) 155 president street, Johannesburg, South Africa. Tel: +874-762919-885. Fax:+874-762919-886. Dear , Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything will be well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.I got your email address while searching for a trustworthy individual. Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.I am Mr. malcom tutu , an auditor with Ned Credict Bank, Johannesburg, South Africa . MY PROPOSITION: A Foreigner a french, Late Engr.Peter Claude (Snr) a merchant in The Republic of South Africa, Formerly working in Witwatersrand Johannesburg Gold Mine, Johannesburg South Africa until his death few year ago in Kenya Air Bus (A310 - 304)Flight KQ431, He banked with us at Ned Credict Bank Johannesburg and had a closing balance as at the end of September, 2000 worth $30,800.000.00 (Thirty Million eight hundred United State Dollars), (this is aside the accrued interest so far from that date) the bank now expects his next of kin as beneficiary. Valuable efforts are being made by the Bank to get in touch with any of the Claude's Family or Relatives but to no success. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of Late Engr. Peter Claude (Snr.)'s next of kin .

Enron,transparent enterprises,"Status: RO Dear Sir, I am Sam Aluko, former special adviser on Petroleum matters to the late Head of State of Government of Nigeria Gen. Sani Abacha. Because of my strategic position in the former Government and also being a close confidant of the late Head of State, I was able to acquire personally the sum of $50,000,000.00 USD ( fifty million United States Dollars only) presently lodged in a Security Deposit in Europe. I made this money largely through ""CONSULTANCY FEE"" and Good Faith Fees"" paid by foreign Oil companies prior to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other Lifting/prospecting Right. Nigeria is the 6th largest Producer/Exporter of Crude Oil in the World. As you are probably aware of the fact that Nigeria is prone to Military coups and the resultant Political/Economic Instability has fueled hyper Inflation, amongst other problems. I have therefore resolved to invest my money abroad, preferable in Real Estate Properties and Importation of Goods from your country for safety and optimum returns on Investment. However the, present civilian administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo has placed a restriction of movement on every member of the cabinet of the past military government. This is as a result of the panel of inquiry slated to investigate most of the atrocities perpetrated by the late former head of state. This means that I cannot travel out now till the panel conclude its investigations which only God knows when that would be. Straight transfer of this money into a bank abroad will present two major problems one, the tax incidence will be too high, as much as 60% of this money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a result of Government deliberate restrictions on flight of capital Abroad. However arrangement have been put in place for you to receive this money from a trust worthy security Deposit Company in Europe. As soon as you indicate your interest. I will send to you the security Code number, certificate of deposit number and airway bill number of the Deposit that will serve as the onus of proof to enable you claim the Money, which is tagged, Diplomatic Luggage. All I now need is an honest partner who can receive the money on my behalf and help me to invest as aforementioned. There is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction, as the money will be delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills. If you are interested in assisting me, please send to me by email immediately your preferred contact address where you can be reached at any time, upon receipt of the money, you are to lodge this money in a bank account and contact me for necessary arrangements for the investment of the funds. For your help and assistance in this deal, you will be entitled to 25% of this money in cash or Equity if you wish to join the proposed company. Finally you are to please urgently send to me through the required contact address that include your telephone and fax number), so that I can instruct the West side Deposit Company to go ahead with the transfer to you Best regards, Sam Aluko ------------------------------------------------------------ http://Game.37.com/ <--- Free Games http://newJoke.com/ <--- J O K E S ! ! !

Enron,IMPORTANT,"FROM: MR TEMI JOHNSON DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. TEL:44 7775770781 EMAIL:temijohnson@rediffmail.com Dear Sir, SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR TEMI JOHNSON of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and GodBless. Best Regards MR TEMI JOHNSON ",no,

Enron,URGENT ASSISTANCE.,"FROM THE DESK OF DR.SAM JORDAN THE MANAGER Headquarter, First Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos, Nigeria. Alternative E-mail: sam01jordan@yahoo.com Sir, Compliment of the day and how is life general with you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and crave your indulgence to make this project request for a joint business transaction which I hope will not come to you as a surprise, hence I plead for your pardon. I am Dr.Sam Jordan, the Manager of headquarter First Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and confidentialbusiness proposal for you. On June 6, 1998, an Italian oil consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum cooperation (NNPC) Mr. Paul Bush made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued at US$43.7,000.00 in my branch. On maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarded address but got no reply after months we send a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum Corporation) that Mr. Paul Bush died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, it was clear that he died without making a will. All attempts by the Australian to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Paul Bush did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his deposit document in my bank. The total sum US$43.7,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant acct. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government. If the account owner is certified death and nobody comes forward to claim it. This is the situation , and my proposal is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the beneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you have to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the proper money transfer document. The money will then be transferred into the account for us to share in the ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with here and there. There is no risk involved. I am using my position and connection in the bank here to do all the document work for the transaction.

Tel No: Your country Intl. access code + 8821652098236 email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com Dear Sir/Madam SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. We were then given this money privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.

Enron,URGENT ASSISTANCE /RELATIONSHIP (P),"Dear Friend, I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria. After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked ""Diplomatic Baggage"". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars). I declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting to US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as ""Precious Stones and Jewellry"" in other that its content will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. However as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account cannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money. Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to move the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries"" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. This business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.

Enron,Request," Dear Sir/Madam ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATE I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocations of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria. Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be as strictly confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, untill the completion of the transaction. Hence our desire to have an overseas agent. I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualize this transaction. The deal, in brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account at the Nigerian Apex Bank (i.e. the Central Bank of Nigeria) and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use in your country.

Enron,URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTEE,"TRANSFER OF USD$22MILLION INTO YOUR ACCOUNT} ATTENTION: President\CEO. I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different organs of Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards transfer of the above-mentioned amount into your bank account. This fund accrued from over invoicing of various contract awarded in my parastatal to certain Foreign Contractors sometimes ago. We, as holders of sensitive position in our various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government to Scrutinise all payments made to certain foreign Contractors and we discovered that some of the contracts they executed were grossly over-invoiced either by omission or commission. In the process the sum of US$27M (Twenty Seven Million US Dollars only) was found lying in the parastatal suspense account after the foreign contractors had been paid their rightful dues for executing the said contracts. We all agreed that this over-invoiced amount be transferred (for our own use) into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, because we are government workers and the Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate foreign accounts. However, we have succeeded in transferring some of this money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (North Africa), but the provider of the account in MOROCCO is up to some mischief and refuses to comply to the earlier mutual agreement by insisting that the total amount be paid into his nominated bank account before disbursement will take effect. If for a meagre sum of US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are not compensated, is it when the balance of US$22M (Twenty-two Million US Dollars)is transferred that we will be sure of our full compensation? Of course, this abuse of trust and inhumanity calls for sober reflection and search for absolute trust. Thus we are seeking your unwavering assistance that the remaining amount of US$22M can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the fund into your account, you will be compensated with 30% of the amount for your assistance and services. So far, much have been said and due to our sensitive positions, we cannot afford a slip in this transaction neither can we give out identity as regards our respective offices, but whereby cordial relationship is established, smooth operations commences, you will be furnished with details of all you deserves to know. I am at your disposition to entertain any question from you with respect to this transaction, so contact me immediately through my e:mail for further information on the requirements and procedure for this transaction. Please, treat with the strictest confidentiality and utmost urgency. Yours faithfully, MR FRED OBI. ",no,
Enron,BUSINESS PROPOSAL,"Importance: HIGH Good day, This might seem very deplorable for a person that you do not know. My name is Clement Apute,I am a lawyer and a very close confidant to my client who also happens to be my sister-in-law. I am contacting you because of the my client's urgent need to go into partnership with someone,who is not from this country, as a result of their family's present situation in the country,and specifically because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed responsibilities, which can stands as a good reason to go into partnership with you. The present situation right now, requires good understanding and a good sense of judgment. My sister-in-law and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with power.This is just a personal vendetta by the head of states, because he was jailed by my client husband's regime in 1997, for actually plotting a coup d 'etat against their military administration then, when they were in power. It is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my client's family. This man is bent on destroying my client's family. The family has virtually lost all their family's money and properties due to this vindictive administration in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family. All their bank accounts have been frozen,assets and their properties which I helped in managing have been confiscated and are still non functional till this present day. His administration has spread so much rumors against their family, which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of hatred to my client's family. Right now it is completely impossible for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling restrictions.About a few months ago we were squished out of another US$395 million dollars, and these wicked people have completely dammed the fact that all this funds can be ascertained for independently. Presently, the family is finding it very hard to manage as we have completely run out of resources, because everything has been taken away from madam and her children. My client needs sombody that she can confide in,presently the family still has some amounts of money to the sum of 84 million US dollars and some fractions in cash,which the family has spread out and lodged in the vault of different Securities outfits in two countries there in Asia and also in Europe. The existence of these monies is not in any way known to anybody else,not even all mama's children, apart from her eldest son. The money was lodged in as jewelry. This is a precaution to maintain a very high level secrecy, because this is all the family have left to fall back on. So we expect you to keep this matter in confidence. Madam wants a partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve some money lodged in any of this security outfits and handle it as duly instructed. The family needs somebody to help them withdraw there deposits because the family is financially down here in the country, since everything they own here have been taken away from them. We are looking for an understanding partner that can work with us. All we require from you is to help the family to go and retrieve any one of the family's deposits that is lodged in one of these places and keep safely in your care, since none of us is able to travel out of this country due to traveling restrictions. Secondly,so that you can always withdraw little part out of their money that will be in your possession and send it down here to us here,anytime the family is in great need. In this way they can continue to sustain the family until they are free from thier enemies. As their lawyer i will be instructing, on how you will go about that. We will be providing you with all the legal documents to make claim on behalf of my client. Please be rest assured that you will have no problems or difficulties in claiming any of these deposits because nobody is aware of the existence of this money.

Enron,URGENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED!,"AFEX BANK OF AFRICA MOHAMMED BELLO (Ph.D) Director/Coordinator Forex & Computer Operations Department Tel/Fax: 234-9-2726223 Sir, Accept my apologies for writing to you in this mode for it might be of inconvenience to you but due to my quest for an honest and reliable international assistance concerning a business here in my country Nigeria I have no other option than to go this length. I need the effectiveness of your professionalism in accomplishing this very business. I am DR. MOHAMMED BELLO Director/coordinator Forex and computer operations department of the Afex Bank of Africa PLC. I am writing this letter to ask your support and cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. We discovered an abandoned sum of $42.500,000.00 (forty two million, Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our customer in Afex Bank of Nigeria, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent (a French citizen and an Engineer executing major Federal contract with governments of West African sub region). He died with a fellow business associate in a ghastly auto crash last October and his remains have since been incarcerated. Since his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put claims as the next of kin and beneficiary to the resources in Monsieur. Ives Laurent account, for it is against the ethics and norms of the finance institution to claim such resources without a beneficiary unless proclaimed by the government. The federal government of Nigeria has given directives to finance institutions to declare adamant accounts that has stayed more than 8months in their custody as they intend to use it to pay off her military peace keeping force (ECOMOG) who fought in War ravaged African countries precisely and as the case may be, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent account fell into this category thus the necessity for contacting you for I am determined to move this fund out as the rigorous and rash economic decision and policies has really turned we government workers to mere civil laborers. I have worked for almost a decade and half and I have nothing to show as reaps and rewards of my hard earned labor. As I need a next of kin/beneficiary and financial assistance to re-claim this resources for I cannot take on this project alone. My attorney and I have propose a commission of 25% out of the total resources for your kind assistance and five 5% has been mapped out to be reimbursed to both parties as sundry expenses incurred in the course of this business. To commence this transaction, I require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return correspondence to this fax number 234-9-2726223 and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number, full name & address, and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer could be made. Note also that this business must be kept strictly confidential because of its nature and can be finalized within a short time depending on the level of your commitment/swiftness. I look forward to receiving your prompt response. Best regards, MOHAMMED BELLO (Ph.D) ",no,

Enron,PRIVATE EMAIL MESSAGE,"Good Day, With warm heart I offer my friendship, and send my best wishes in this special season. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek! political asylum. I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here. I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction. My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

Enron,Business Cooperation ( Inheritance Claim),"From: Mr.Daniel Osondu Fax: Number +23417597019 Dear Sir, I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Daniel Osondu an auditor at one of the Banks in lagos-Nigeria. During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $18.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Manfred Becker, a foreigner who died in a crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted our curiosity. I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the Ministry that he executed the contract for and also with our Bank. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Thomas Danababa , that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via my confidential fax number +23417597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. I expect your urgent response. Regards, Mr. Daniel Osondu confidential e-mail ",no,
Enron,(No Subject),"Dear Sir, First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of it\92s nature as being very CONFIDENTIAL. I am a Senior Manager with a commercial bank . I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign country. THE PREPOSITION The late JERRY ADAMS a Foreigner and an oil merchant / contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria until his death four years ago in a plane crash, banked with us and had a closing balance of USD10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars). The bank now unquestionably expect it to be claimed by JERRY ADAMS\92 next of kin. Efforts have been made by my bank to get in touch with any of the ADAMS\92 Family but to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate JERRY ADAMS\92 next of kin (NOK) that the management under the influence of our Executive Director has agreed that since the incident occurred in 1997 and has left the fund dormant and devalued, we should transfer the fund overseas and utilize it either on stock exchange market or personal business interest. Your role is very important as the fund when concluded on transfer would be justifiably presented as having been remitted to JERRY ADAMS\92 next of kin (NOK) . Your interest will be protected as unnecessary documentation will be avoided. Note that all modalities necessary for execution of the business have been perfected. The money will be shared equally i.e 50% for you 50% for us, expenses too will be shared equally . It is a risk-free deal.

Enron,I Need Your Assistance.," Dear sir, It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the ""Personal will"" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this ""SOS"" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him (my Attorney) on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. I look forward to your quick response. Best Wishes, Mrs. Maryam Abacha",no,

RE:  TRANSFER OF ($26,000.000.00 USD}
        TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer to overseas account          
($26,000.000.00 USD) Twenty six million United States Dollars) from a Prime Bank here in South Africa, I want to ask you, If you are not capable= to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c= immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for this important business trusting in you and believing in God that you will neve= r let me down either now or in future.

I am the Auditor General of one of the prime bankshere in South Africa,= during the course of our auditing,I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1996 and since 1998 nobody has operated on this account again,after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money
out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is PEDRO F. HASLE= R a foreigner, a great industrialist and he died since 1998.No other
person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well= that until his death he was the manager GOLD ARK [pty]. SA.

We will start the first transfer with Six million [$6,000.000] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the
payment of the remaining rest amount to your account.

The total amount involve is Twenty six million United States Dollars only [$26,000.000.00]. I want to first transfer $6,000.000.00 [Six million= United States
Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest. But I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, without valid international foreign
passport, but ca= n only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner too, and the money can only= be approved into foreign /c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together when we meet face to face after the first transfer of $6 Million before transferring the second part of $20 Million. I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a bindin= g agreement that will bind us together immediately after the first transfer before we fly to
your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you upon your= positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with instruction of  a key
bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and my position in the bank the bank official can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account that you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official Will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you can call me for heart to heart discussion through my private satellite phone
which I secured for the security and safety of this business as you know that this= business is confidential.I will use my position and influence to obtain al= l legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries and foreign exchange
departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email
address.

Yours truly
Dopp Bob

I contacted you because of my need to deal with person/persons who my family and I have had no previous personal relationship with. An adventist friend of the family introduced you to me. Since the death of my husband, my family had been subjected to all sorts of harrassment and intimidation with lots of negative reports emanating from the government and the press about my husband. The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts are frozen and all assests siezed. It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in the transfer of the sum of US$100Million only being the very last of my family fund in my possession and control. The Federal Government have seized all our properties and frozen all our accounts both local and international, but my only hope now is the available US$100Million cash, which I carefully packaged and deposited with a security finance company in Holland. My purpose of contacting you is for someone who will be able to pay the dumurrage charges incured in the security finance company and also after transfering the funds, will be able to invest the funds on my behalf till such a time when I will be free from my present predicament. Your benefit I can assure you will be very substantial. Please ensure to keep this proposal very secret and confidential for obvious reasons and send to us your private telephone and fax numbers for easy and confidential communication.

Enron,From:Savimbi Denis,"TTN: SIR/MADAM I understand that this letter will be of great surprise to you ,Especially as itcomes from a stranger .I am Prince.Dennis Melange Savimbi from the republic ofAngola.I got your contact from the internet while i was searching for a foreignerwho can help me in this case. On the 22nd of february 2002, the rebel leader JONAS SAVIMBI my dad was killed.butbefore his death,he told me secretly that he deposited some money for us in case heis killed,we should flee for our lives.the money he said was supposed to be forammunitions.he told me that he divided the money for ammunitions and gave some ofthe money to the head of Armed and Ammunition Procurement Division , and sent themon a mission to NIGERIA with the sum of (US$30Million United State Dollars) toenable them stay there and negotiate with any of the Europe or America country asregards the buying and shipment of arms and ammunition into my country . The moneywas conveyed to NIGERIA through diplomatic means and the other part ($25M) wasdeposited at a Security Company in Nigeria by my father, while they were negotiatingthe arms deal.THE MONEY HE SAID WAS DEPOSITED IN MY NAME. During the begining part of last year ,we heard my father was dead and so,i remebered that my dad talked about some money he kept for us in the security vaultin Nigeria.i also remembered that he said we should immediately flee for our saftyto anywhere that is safe.so,i decided that the money must be cleared and used forsomething that will make us ok in life. my mum had resolved to end the war in my country.She needed oversea medical attention for her heart disease and as a result,she wanted us to get out of thecountry for the sake of our safety. So , we thus agreed to look for a God fearing person oversea who can assist us inclaiming these fund and deposit it into his or her personal/company account. So,Weare soliciting for your assistance on this matter ;as this stands to be the onlyhope for the future survival of the Family cause we cannot travel out of the countrybecause things are not yet settled. Presently we are seeking assylum in Nigeria,since it became necessary for us to live my country completly for securityreasons and the money is here in Nigeria in a security company ; fortunately enoughthis company we believe is closer to us and so,we will instruct them to airship itto netherland where they have diplomatic immunities for fear of discovery we willdiscuss with the company as regards the money in their Nigerian Office, but for thefact that we have not got any contact from out side Africa for now we are unable togive the instructions. This is the more reason why we are contacting you. Here inNigeria ;we have limited right to invest this fund ; considering the means in whichthe money was acquired, and Nigeria been a African Nation ,Hence we took this decision .In antipation of your assistance we have agreed to give: 30% of the totalsum to you,10% mapped out to cover any expenses that may be incuried in course ofthe transaction, 60% for me and my family. We wish to invest this fund in yourcountry ,this transaction is 100% risk free as we have concluded all necessaryarrangments before contacting you. We expect your favourable response, indicate your private Telephone and Fax numbersfor easy comunication. Upon comfirming your readiness to assist we shall get all necessarydocument including the certificate of Deposit made in your name as it was merelydeposited by my father as family valuables. Thanks For your Co-operation, We expect to here from you .

Enron,TOP SECRET AND CONFIDENTIAL.,">From The Desk of: MR.Sadik Adebayo (FINANCIAL DIRECTOR) UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC. Dear Sir, BUSINESS PROPOSAL. Please permit me to introduce myself. I am the Financial Director of Union Bank of Nigeria PLC. Union Bank is one of the biggest Commercial Banks in Nigeria. The Board of Directors of the Bank met on the 13th of November over a matter that requires your co-operation and assistance. In 1996, one of our esteemed customers, Mr. Adil Bantam, an Indonesian citizen who died in a plane crash along with members of his family. The ADC plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Lagos, killing all the passengers and crew. Before the death of Mr. Adil Bantam, he was the Managing Director of Deep-blue Oil Servicing Company. His company has both current and savings accounts with our Bank. At the time of his death, he had US$26.6Million in both accounts.When our Bank was notified of his death, we made efforts to contact his immediate next of kin through his embassy in Victoria Island, Lagos. The embassy later wrote to us informing us that all attempt on their part to contact any of his relatives was not successful. It was at this point we contacted the government of Nigeria through the Ministry of Finance informing them about this problem. The government wrote to us back directing our Bank to place Mr. Adil Bantam funds in a suspense account pending when any of his relatives shows up to claim the money. This was in 1996. However, we received instructions from the Nigerian Government giving us till the end of December 2002 to disburse this fund to the next of kin of Mr. Adil Bantam, or the money will be used to buy arms to support the civil wars in Sierra Leone and Angola. It was as a result of these directives from government that made the Board of Directors of our Bank to meet. After careful considerations of the intention of government to use the money to support war instead of eradicating disease and poverty, the board then mandated me to contact you for assistance to receive this money as the next of kin to Mr. Adil Bantam. What we want to do is to present you or your company as the next of kin to Mr. Adil Bantam which will entitle you to receive this money on his behalf. It will not be difficult to establish the relationship. You could be a relative to his later wife or his uncle from his mother\92s side. As soon as you confirm your willingness to assist, you shall be provided with all information relating to the Late Mr.Adil Bantam, as contained in our file. You do not have to worry about this proposal, as the Board of Union Bank is 100% behind this proposal. When we have successfully remitted the fund in your account, you shall assist us invest our shares into profitable business in your country for 2years. Your interest will be 30% of the total sum after the successful completion of this transaction.Sir, should you be willing to assist in this matter,kindly get back to me on my Telephone number +234-803-3044193 stating your telephone and fax numbers along with your bank detail were the money will be transfer to and any question you may need to ask about this transaction. We want to assure you of a hitch free transaction, as your involvement will not expose you to any risks now or after the successful completion of the transaction. We thank you once more while we look forward to your urgent response to this letter. Best regards, MR.Sadik Adebayo. __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of late Engr. William Adams's next of kin (he had no known wife and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman, board of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an arrangement for the fund to be declared ""UNCLIAMABLE "" and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund for Arms and Ammunition, which will further enhance the course of war in Africa and the world in general. In order to avert this negative development, myself and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as late Engr.WILLIAMS ADAMSs next of kin so that the fund, USD$22.2M, would be subsequently transferred and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next of kin.

Enron,INHERITANCE CLAIM," ATTN:MANAGING DIRECTOR I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal Ministries in lagos-Nigeria. During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $16.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my curiosity. I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement.

Enron,ASSISTANCE,"Dear Sir I am mr Godwin Igbunu, the Bank Manager of Regent Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1997, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger Berget made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$8,000,000.00 (Eight Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Ministry of Defence headquater in Abuja that Mr. Roger Berget died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin to date has fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Berget did not declare any kin or relations in! all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$8,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Berget so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names, address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and not! arization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on either sides during the course of this transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

I contacted you because of my need to deal with person/persons who my family and I have had no previous personal relationship with. An adventist friend of the family introduced you to me. Since the death of my husband, my family had been subjected to all sorts of harrassment and intimidation with lots of negative reports emanating from the government and the press about my husband. The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts are frozen and all assests siezed. It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in the transfer of the sum of US$100Million only being the very last of my family fund in my possession and control. The Federal Government have seized all our properties and frozen all our accounts both local and international, but my only hope now is the available US$100Million cash, which I carefully packaged and deposited with a security finance company in Holland. My purpose of contacting you is for someone who will be able to pay the dumurrage charges incured in the security finance company and also after transfering the funds, will be able to invest the funds on my behalf till such a time when I will be free from my present predicament. Your benefit I can assure you will be very substantial. Please ensure to keep this proposal very secret and confidential for obvious reasons and send to us your private telephone and fax numbers for easy and confidential communication.

Enron,hi friend,"Status: RO Dear friend, RE save our soul I am Mrs. Deborah Kabila, one of the wives of Late President Laurent D. Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Consequent upon the assassination of my husband, I am in possession of USD 58,000,000 (Fifty Eight Million US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for special projects. This fund has since been deposited in a security company in West African Country of Togo where I am residing now with my children. It is now my intention to move the said fund out of this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of my children and I, for immediate investment. Based on this that I solicited for your assistance to enable me take this money out of Togo. However, note that my children and I have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the offer of assisting us. Also it will be your responsibility in directing us on a viable business. It is also my intention to relocate and probably take a temporarily resident in your country pending when all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon as we arrived. To conclude this transaction, you will be required to come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in Togo where the security company will deposit the total sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be remitted into your original bank in your country. Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to your country, where my children and I are expected to take a temporary resident. Please note that I can not open any Bank account with my name because, My late husband's first son-JOSEPH-who took over power in our country, don't want to see me and my children, He claimed that when our husband was alive, that I was very close to him than any other of his wives including his (Joseph) mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness to him that I was able to get things from him more than others. As a result he has been monitoring me. Infact this one of the main reasons I want to take my children out of our country and any nearby country. Thanking you in advance. Yours faithfully, Deborah Kabila (Mrs.) N/B: Kindly give me your direct telephone,fax and your mobile telephone numbers for more explanations. ------------------------------------------------------------ http://Game.37.com/ <--- Free Games http://newJoke.com/ <--- J O K E S ! ! !

Enron,URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL,"KAMBILI BOB 3/5 RIDES GARDEN CLOSE JO'BURG, SOUTH AFRICA MY DEAR , I am Bob Kambili, Bank manager of First national bank South Africa Pty, South Africa,(www.fnb.co.za) and for reasons which will become obvious to you as read on, I obtained your address particulars from an Internet address listing. Please exercise some patience and read through my message. You can reach me immediately on my private email address (henryfnbsa@mail.com) I have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6th 1998, a Gold Consultant/Contractor with the South African National Gold Corporation, Mr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa , a national of Iraq, made a numbered time ( fixed) deposit for 12 calendar months, value USD52,000,000.00 (FIFTY TWO MILION DOLLAS) in my branch. On maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, his contract employers, the South African National Gold Corporation wrote to inform us that Mr. A Y Mustafa died from an automobile accident; that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin through the Iraqi embassy were fruitless. At first I was surprised that I did not receive much official cooperation in my inquiries in order to trace his kin in Iraq, and inform them about Mr. Mustafa\92s deposit of USD52m plus accrued interest. I therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had actively opposed the Government of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and was consequently driven into exile. Being an minning Expert,he subsequently obtained a job with the South Africa Gold Coporation, and settled in South Africa. Thereafter, he walked into my Office to make the aforementioned deposit of USD52m. He did not declare any kin in his application paperwork, contrary to laid down procedures, and when I asked him he informed me that he wished it so. I accepted his application because banks are conservative and will always honour a customer\92s wishes, especially high networth customers. No one knows the source of his money because apparently the time frame of his employment with the ASGC does indeed preclude such a large amount of money. It can be assumed that he brought his money over from Iraq, but that is open to speculation. However, the point is that his employers are not aware of this money , and therefore it can be safely assumed that no one will ever come forward to claim this money. This money total USD52m ( inclusive of accrued interests) is still sitting in my Bank in the Dormant Account Portfolio. No one will ever come forward to claim it now, and according to South African law, after 5 years, the money will automatically revert to the Federal Government Treasury if the Account owner is a foreigner, is certified dead , and there is no valid claim. This indeed, is the situation. My proposal therefore is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood relation to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is not also necessary to come from the same Country. I have worked out the modalities to achieve my aim of appointing a next of kin, and therefore also by this means transfer this money total USD52m abroad for us to share. The method of achieving the objective of transferring this money abroad in a completely legal and proper way is simple. I intend to use a n Attorney ( representing you as BENEFICIARY) to execute a series of affidavits in support of your claim. These will be approved. The money transfer paperwork itself will include a certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does not ask questions or refuse the money as money laundering. Also, the paperwork will include proper certification that the funds being transferred are from non criminal sources. In short this will be a proper and legal money transfer and there is no risk!. I will have to process the initial paperwork to obtain approval from the Probate Registry ( Ministry of Justice ) to obtain the Letter of Administration empowering you as Sole trustee/executor to the Estate of Mr. Mustafa. If you therefore agree to be the official Beneficiary, then please note that you will not be required to sign any Money Transfer Documents ( my Attorney will do all (that), you will not be required to come to South Africa. Only the following is required from you: (1) Send to me immediately A bank account ( a bank account with zero credit balance is ok) (2) Complete name and address of the Bank (3) Bank Account Number (4) Name of Account Holder/Beneficiary (5) Your address, phone and fax (6) A brief background information on you (CV) Once you send me the requested information as above, I will initiate the processing of the transfer and in about 7 working days the money total USD52m will be in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. This transaction is guaranteed to succeed without any problems. If you agree to assist me by sending me the above requested information, I will give you my complete address, including phone/ fax etc and any further clarifications you may require. Looking forward to your urgent reply. Yours truly Kambili. __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?
